Stable tag: trunk

Adds AJAX-driven options to some admin management pages with CMS-known functions like toggling post/page visibility without having to open the edit screens, **plus changing page order with drag'n'drop** and inline category management.

== Description ==

When you want to edit properties of posts/pages, you'll have to open the edit page, set the new options and save the post/page… which obviously takes time. For those who are using **WordPress as a CMS**, it's important to be able to manage contents easily and quickly. That's what this plugin helps to do.

It adds some icons to the Manage posts/pages view with **AJAX-driven** CMS-known functions like toggling post/page visibility, changing publication date and title **without having to open the edit screens or reload the page**, **plus changing page order with drag'n'drop**, inline category management and inline tag management.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why cant I set the time with the inline calendar? =

Well, show me a neat jQuery calendar plugin that can entirely be localized and that offers time settings, and it'll propably find its way into the plugin. ;-)

= Why isn't this or that implemented to improve the admin interface? =

If you have suggestions please let me know by dropping me a line via e-mail or the wp.org forums.
